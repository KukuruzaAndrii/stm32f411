STM32F411

This is a collection of things I am doing pertaining to the STM32F411
microcontroller that is found on so called "black pill" boards from
China.  I received my first of these on 11-20-2020 and away we go.

Many of these examples are based on my STM32F103 projects on the
so called "blue pill" boards.  You can find these projects here:

Also see notes on my web page here:

Also, David Welch has done a lot of work on these chips and boards
as well as other things in the STM32 world

Here is sort of an index to what you find here:

* ST-Link - initial experiments with openocd and my ST-Link adapter
* blink1 - the most basic LED blinking demo I can manage
